              <p> If <b>Call Me By Your Name</b> is the perfect encapsulation of first love, then <b>In the Mood for Love</b> is a haunting echo of letting that breath go. And so I travelled alone to the great temples, listened to the nature of daylight, and whispered twenty-one years of heartbreak into the stone age.</p>

<i> - In the Mood for Love </i>
 </p>
             
              <p> Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap, Cambodia, houses the remains of several capitals of the Khmer Empire from the 9th to 15th centuries. Since I was kindergarten aged and dragged along by grandma to pray at Buddhist temples during New Years, I have never shown much interest in religious structures except for the stories about dead childrens' souls nestling leaves of the huge Indian almonds in the courtyards. So I decided that on my Southeast Asia pilgrimage, I would keep temple time to the minimum amount possible without looking uncultured. Since I only had one shot, Bhutan was too expensive to fly to, and I had no interest in gold-lined, plated, and painted temples, 'this Angkor Wat place' rated number 1 on so many travel guides was the place to be. I surrendered a hundred bucks (NZD) for the full 3 day admission, refused to buy the picture book guide for another hundred, rejected a private tour guide for 70, got a tuktuk and driver for 20, a free bike rental, and the backgroud knowledge from 2 google searches and a 3 minute movie scene with no dialogue.</p>
              <p> I guess what I'm meaning to say is that this post contains zero culture, and was fabricated entirely from excessive instrospection (and probably a dash of heatstroke inspired fantasies) birthing surreal convictions in the form of convoluted high-school-level fanfiction.  </p>

         <h1> Prologue </h1>
         <p>Being a curated youth at the airport, I was scrolling through my instagram wearing faded stripes and dirty black leather sandals. </p>
        <p> A man said hello from the next table.</p>

<p>He had come from Jakarta to Lombok on legal business, working on a contract case. A building was completed but payment refused. Being a law student, I of course advertised that I was one. He hushed me silly for he was more than just a lawyer- he was an engineer and an accountant before that.  He even had two wives. I still forget how to do integrals after four years at uni and this grandpa lived out three full lives. </p>

<p>A younger man joined us then, Mr Ogawa from the same airport shuttle I took there. Engineer met engineer, and the men exchanged their office addresses in Jakarta, and made foundation drawings on the back of an e-ticket printout. </p>

<p>Trying to be inclusive of the science fail, the lawyer suggested that fate was real, and that our meeting here was something special. He even said that I might become the engineer's wife one day.</p>

<p>I pretended to be mortified, while secretly harbouring a desire to marry a wealthy senpai and move to the Japanese countryside. </p>

<p>Moments after the awkward laughter, the old Mr Widodo thanked us for our company, and promised to pass on our irrelevant opinions to President Widodo. </p>

<p> I sadly report that the Indonesian government updated no laws or policies thanks to me. Also, senpai didn't notice me.

 </p>
        
        <p> Most days, I forgot. I laughed with my friends over mix veg rice, made faces at steamed egg, and listened to the same song on the bus for weeks. I knew to bring sweaters to class, and that an iced drink + AC for breakfast sometimes gave me diarrhea. Routine made me feel like my life had always been this way. And then on the way home, after a shower, or sitting alone with stale chips and a McSpicy at the McDonalds in Clementi, watching all the last bus goers... something happened. Thinking about the old lady walking down the road, rain bluring street lights on a taxi window, feeling a dense breeze through the vents in my bedroom; some things triggered thoughts I haven't had in a while. And then I'm shaken awake, thinking about a line of trees in winter with branches like hands in the indigo, remembering the scratched texture of that round metal table I came to sit at, replaying the ending montage from Arrival, and thinking of you.  </p>
        
        <p> And I wondered, and wondered, and wondered. I walked through those days again, getting lost in blurry words to lose footing in an autumn gust swinging doors and sinking brown suede in a puddle, under a little umbrella. I was underwater, trying to see through bubbles. You ran through my fingers, and I gasped for air. I sat above Erlich's pool, looking down at myself. No tears came, I dried off, and forgot you over dinner. </p>
        
        <p> The broken roads of Siem Reap threw dust high in the hot air, and I squinted at the bright light. After nearly being thrown off the creaking tuktuk, I dragged my feet accross the floating plastic bridge, and sighed at the woman spreading her chiffon train on the steps of the entrance. She modestly leaned her white legs to the side, knees together, and peered at the camera with her chin tucked. I waited, fearing for the worst.
        </p>
        
        <p> The main corridors were packed with bodies; tour guides yelled into speakers to gather the herd in the main halls, and sanwiched everyone else with them. I fought my way past umbrellas in the shade. Stumbling into a the side gallery, I was comforted by the smell of incense. I walked through symmetrical arches, understanding nothing but impressed by the architechure. A guide was passionately lecturing on the war mural to a family staring outside into the bright day. The child sat on the side, dangling his legs and the mother watched her son, squatting and fanning herself. The father asked if they could move on from this war of king so and so, and the tour guide immediately rejected: "No! 5 more minutes!"
        </p>
        
        <p> The current of the day took me further into the temple, and finally up to its elevated central structure. After just a few steps up the stairs, the couple in front of me stopped, and the woman looked quite dazed. I asked if she was okay.</p>
        
         <p>
       "No, she is NOT okay!" her husband snapped, glaring at me. </p>
        <p> I survived for an hour, but my romantic dreams were broken. I came to find peace in the largest religious monument in the world, and instead of finding Tony Leung with a jacket suavely slung over his jacket, I was drowing under the sass of over-roasted people in the 33C heat. </p>
        
        <p> And then they left. </p>
        
        <p> The clock striked 12:30, when all the tour schedules rolled over to lunch. Within a few minutes, I became the only person in that inner courtyard. The silence that followed fell like first light, and it takes me a moment to breathe it all in. There was harshness in the unwavering midday sun. And there was loudness in the silence, like tuning into cicadas on still summer days. As if waking inside a dream, I felt the weight of bricks and the age of pillars pressing on my chest, a twinge of sadness in this behemoth grandeur. Angkor Wat had come alive. </p>
        <p> It was like reaching the summit, floating above the drop-off into the deep blue, or holding a child for the first time. Wonder was reborn. I remembered it like a smell I couldn't name, this vastness, deep resonance, the age of stars beyond, the horizon coming full circle. I was a fledgling swept a gust of wind. It knocked the breath from my throat, and a shiver runs down my back. I could only understand frames of the world hanging before me, imagine time that I would never live, and cry over pebbles on my knees. There was only one absolute, and that was impermanence. I looked to the light, cusped my hands, and sprung from darkness the words: I loved you. Time passed like waves over rocks, and when the sun rose again, I would remember you like the wind: just a shiver.

          <h3> The hole from In the Mood for Love. </h3>
          
          <p> The solemn Angkor Wat gave me a momemnt in which I cooked self-revelations full of hot air, and made me feel #blessed for the rest of they day. The afternoon was ripe when I got to Angkor Thom and Bayon temple. I'm guessing that it was not recently restored as other temples, because the stones were covered in plenty of moss and lichen, with saplings sprouting from the cracks. This unpolished look, coupled with the head structures full of rounded shapes of heads and indistinct edges, in contrast to Angkor Wat's long symmetrical halls and square libraries, made Bayon feel like the ruins of an ancient city. For those who play Skyrim, this was real life Markarth.</p>

            <img class="portpic" src="sr2205/IMG_7063.JPG" />
            
            
            <p> I visited a few other temples in the rest of my tuktuk day, but Angkor Wat and Bayon were by far my favourite. Worst parst of the day was probably Phnom Bakheng, where there was a long line approaching sunset as the site was elevated and could only hold so many people at a time. The hike up the hill was small, the line about 15 minutes, but totally not worth the clouded sunset and 200 people standing around taking photos of clouds. </p>
             <img class="landpic" src="sr2205/IMG_7183.JPG" />
            <h3> The reality behind aesthetic Lonely Planet photos.</h3>
            
            <p> Over the remaing 2 days of my pass, I returned to Angkor on bike and experienced how much physical conditions change perception. I never did make that sunrise over Angkor Wat, but came in the late afternoons brewing soft drizzles one day and then honeyed light the next. The Angkor Wat I knew of scorching heat became mellow under the overcast and the golden hour, and I no longer felt like a girl flung out of space. Pictures that I thought were branded into my mind, were just scratches on a glass pane. I gave up on mercurial love lines, and made use of the soft lighting for #instatime.  </p>

        <h1> Food Scout : Siem Reap</h1>
        <h3> Like Food Ranger. Except rude. </h3>
        <p> Siem Reap was a little Hanoi to me, centered along the Siem Reap River like Hanoi swirling around Hoan Kiem Lake. Big trees lined streets of motorbikes, along with French buildings from a shared colonial past. Pub Street was full of gaudy lights and Westerners, but not as cramped as Hanoi Old Quarters. Dinners with entrée and a cocktail at mid-tier restaurants cost around $10, and a pint goes as low as $1 without needing to sit on the street. The traffic wasn't bad, and though I watched that Al Jazeera video on gang rape in Cambodia, my local friends assured me that Siem Reap, at least, was a safe city to walk around after dark in. </p>
        
        <p>I made two friends from Bromo, Narak and Job, who happened be locals here. They were kind enough to waste a lot of time keeping me company amongst their busy work and school lives.</p>
       <p> "No expensive food in Siem Reap tastes good," Narak assured me. The boys laughed at my pride in securing a table at <b>Cuisine Wat Damnak</b>, one of the best fine dining in Siem Reap according to better sources than just shitty TripAdvisor.  </p>
        <p> Being an upper lower class woman pulling up in a $2 tuk-tuk every night to dinner, sleeping on both of my twin beds, and looking for no real, raw, and rustic experiences whatsoever, I decided I didn't need no local people telling me not to waste my money. We had done our time eating $2 nasi goreng and sniffing sulphur together, and now I was moving up in life. </p>
        
       <img class="landpic" src="sr2205/IMG_7242.JPG"/>
       <h3> Understated luxury ooooooooohhhhhhh </h3>
       
       <p> 6 courses for $50 sounded like a deal not to be found in New Zealand, and was I disappointed? </p>
       <p> Well, a little. </p>
       
       <p> My favourite 2 courses were the salad with pork belly and pineapple, and the prawn with tamarind sauce and brown rice. Clean, well balanced combinations, with clear flavours. </p> <img class="landpic" src="sr2205/IMG_7236.jpg" style="margin-bottom:20px"/>
        <img class="landpic" src="sr2205/IMG_7239.jpg"/>
        <p>
        This was my favourite kind of food: "bland" according to my friends, but I prefer to call it simple cooking with fresh ingredients. My mum often called my palate "country tastebuds", because rural grandma homecooking was the only cooking I could never get sick of. And this fine dining just took me home. Except my grandma makes the exact dishes for $10, not $50. </p>
        <p>I thought so before, but this meal really confirmed just how similar Vietnamese and Khmer food were. Ingredients like water spinach, star fruit, water lily stems, cowslip creeper, lotus seed, tamarind, and so on, are common Southeast Asian ingredients, and fish sauce with the lime and sugar twist particularly point to Thai, Khmer, and Vietnamese food. Crunchy salads, zesty spice and well seasoned meat are what comes to mind when I think of the Vietnamese homecooking I love so much. And though the freshness and balance is certainly met at Wat Damnak, and surpasses the common greasy flat flavours of eating out, there isn't the same body, heartiness and complex spontaneity of a grandma eyeballing a bottle of fish sauce into the mix or throwing in some extra lime leaves. Although my diner was refined and perfected, I grew up by the rice paddies eating these dishes by an oil lamp on power outaged nights, and this wasn't how these dishes were made. It's not as if I was having <i>kaiseki</i> in my ryokan with a private onsen, I was tasting farmers' dishes made with weeds sprouting from the creek side. I looked around me and I was the only Asian on the second floor of the restaurant serving dishes that were 95% Khmer, made "contemporary" by the French head chef Johannes Rivieres, and served to me under long French titles practiced by Khmer waitors in loose-fitting brown cotton. Rivieres described the menu as “Cambodian food with a French sensitivity” (Culture Trip). I'm just not sure if this <i>"French sensitivity" </i> is worth it. Sure, it's made poor people food comfortable for rich people, but it also seemed a tad... colonial.  </p>

<i> - Get Out </i>
 </p>
        
        <p> The verdict on Cuisine Wat Damnak is that if you've never tried Khmer food before, this might be a worthy introduction if you want to feel rich in a third world country. But if you have a relative or friend who will cook Khmer food for you, just go to them instead. And always, always trust your local friends. If they don't know about this shnazzy Culture Trip reccomended restaurant trying to cook local food, well then. Yeah. Maybe try eating bugs instead. Because Siem Reap has a higher concentration of critters than I've ever seen, and they will eat you. So you should eat them too. </p>
